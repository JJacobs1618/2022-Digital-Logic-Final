## Description

- Motivation: Create a functional ALU in Verilog to perform basic arithmetic functions including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and boolean operations.
- Why: To gain hands-on experience in digital logic design, development in Verilog, and deeper understanding of how computers function at the logic gate level.
- Lessons Learned: Deeper understanding of how logic gates can be used to provide all necessary functionality for modern computing.
